                <p>    Flowers play a huge role in the culture of Hawai’i. The lush, tropical climate and fertile volcanic soil make it possible for most anything to grow, and over centuries various species have made their way to the islands either naturally, by canoe with the first Polynesian settlers, or in modern times from visitors the world over. The most popular flower lei in Hawai’i reflect this diverse background. Leaves from the ti plant are twisted in to an open-ended lei and combined with tuberose from Mexico. Kukui (candlewood) nuts brought with the first Polynesians are woven with invasive sea grapes, while maile leaves, from a vine native to Hawai’i, are woven into an open-ended lei that rests on the shoulders of the groom and delicate strands of fragrant pikake (Arabian Jasmine), originally brought to Hawai’i by Chinese immigrants, adorn the shoulders of the bride. </p><!-- This is a placeholder!
